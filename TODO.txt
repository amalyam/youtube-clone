- update gcs-cors.json origin to website domain and any other possible origins once deployed
- refactor Video interface by creating video-api-service, implement REST API endpoints, make requests to the service (using axios?)
- Video interface is currently used in:
    - video-processing-service/src/firestore.ts
    - yt-web-client/yt-clone/app/firebase/functions.ts
    - yt-api-service/functions/src/index.ts
- add custom thumbnails
- add info like date uploaded, title, etc. to each video
